### Specification

This program is designed to record the different vendors along with their current and past orders from Pierre's Bakery. Pierre can track the order history by checking the different catagories along with the items that are added in each catageory. For instance: Vendor One ordered twelve loaves of bread. If Pierre wanted to check how many loaves of bread Vendor One ordered, all he has to go to open the 'Homepage', click on 'Vendor One', then click on 'Items' to see the order. Once the order is delivered, Pierre is able to clear the list by clicking on the 'Clear' button.
